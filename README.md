# PHPinit Preview
Management and example preview tool for the PHPinit models.

The client is the website you see on [phpinit.com](https://phpinit.com) and the content management system (cms) is stored on my localhost and is used to create and administrate the content of the client side.

You can click further into either client or cms for more detailed information about each project, such as technologies used and logic behind.

Both these website, the client and cms, are quite simple and small and are build on my [tiny mvc framework](https://github.com/Stickano/mvcPhp) and they each use a couple of the PHPinit models.

PHPinit is a set of PHP models that can be used for a variety of backend functionality, for your web based projects. You can study the models [here on Github](https://github.com/Stickano/Phpinit) or preview an example on [phpinit.com](https://phpinit.com).
